          "question": "Scarlett O'Hara famously asked her husband, Rhett Butler, \"Where shall I go?\" to which he famously replied, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" One of the finest movie quotations ever is found toward the end of director Victor Fleming's 1939 American historical romantic epic film, Gone with the Wind. But in 1930s American society, the term 'damn' was a swear word. Due to the word's offensive nature and consequent prohibition by the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, sometimes known as the 'Hays Code', American film censors insisted on its removal two months prior to the movie's release. A few weeks before the movie's release, the Motion Picture Association of America board amended the Production Code, which caused the censors to change their minds. A word that had originally been offensive became suddenly unoffensive, most likely as a result of the changed sensitivities of American culture that made it possible to update the Motion Picture Production Code. Since then, American perceptions of these issues have advanced significantly. What is offensive to society will continue to be offensive unless its sensibilities significantly shift. People's senses, belief systems, conventions, and practices don't change suddenly. They develop slowly. Therefore, it is meaningless to inquire as to why something should be offensive to some while not being so to others, or why people aren't saner and more tolerant when it comes to sensitive and disputed social topics. Cinema has a significant impact on its consumers since it is a captivating audio-visual medium of entertainment that teaches information, knowledge, beliefs, values, etc. A film's effects on people and society can be either beneficial or bad depending on its subject matter and method of presentation. While a movie may be suitable for certain people's age and sensibilities, it may not be suitable for other people's age and sensibilities. Not everyone is intended to watch every movie. A controversial movie might also spark societal turmoil or even violence. As a result, every nation requires a formal agency to oversee its cinema ethics and policy. In India, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), sometimes known as the 'Censor Board', must certify a movie as appropriate for the purpose before it can be released for public screening. Under the Cinematograph Act of 1952, the CBFC, which operates as a statutory agency under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, controls how movies are shown. Its responsibility is to make sure that the nation's citizens enjoy wholesome enjoyment through cinematic media. The CBFC is required to certify that a movie, in whole or in part, does not jeopardise India's sovereignty and integrity, jeopardise its security and relations with foreign states, cause public disorder or crime, cause defamation or court contempt, violate social norms and values, offend any group of people or community, etc. \n\nQ.

Meanwhile, a Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, enquired the reason for which the fox was in the well. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and told the goat that he deliberately jumped in the well to enjoy its benefits. He kept encouraging the goat to jump in the well. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.” \n Q.

As our fauna is facing a dearth of adequate shelter in forests, they are heading towards towns and hence get killed by hunters. Consequently, many animal species have either become extinct or are on the verge of extinction. The Black Buck is almost endangered and found only in two countries, Nepal and India. In India, this antelope is found in many national parks like Guindy National Park, Point Calimere and Vellandu sanctuaries of Tamil Nadu, Rollapadu of Andhra Pradesh, few parts of Rajasthan and Haryana. As far as their habitat is concerned, they live in open grasslands, dry areas or thinly populated areas and near water resources. They live in the desert areas of Rajasthan and coastal areas because they cannot sustain cold climate. They are the fastest running animals on this planet. Further, this animal is active during the day, but slows down in its activities after mid-day. They are social beings. Hence, they move with their herds, which can vary from 3 to 23 mates. They cohabit twice in a year and give birth twice in a year. Prior to independence, this antelope was extensively hunted which affected their population so much that this species has reached the stage of extinction in many parts of the country. Poachers kill them mainly for material gain. Its skin has an enormous value in the market. In order to protect this species, the IUCN has declared this species nearly threatened. Hence, under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, numerous stern measures have been taken. To specify a few, Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary (Bihar), Gir Forest National Park, Velavadar Wildlife Sanctuary (Gujarat), National Chambal Sanctuary, etc. Despite these acts, hunting is adversely affecting our wildlife. There are some solutions to this problem but the best one is to boycott the products made from endangered species at an international level.

One day, while wandering through a secluded forest, she stumbled upon an ancient-looking map half-buried in the undergrowth. The map depicted a trail that led to a legendary waterfall rumoured to possess magical properties. Driven by her curiosity, Lena decided to follow the trail. As she walked deeper into the forest, the atmosphere grew more enchanting. Sunlight filtered through the thick canopy, casting dappled patterns on the ground. The sound of rustling leaves and distant bird calls created a symphony of nature around her. Guided by the map's markings, Lena navigated through challenging terrains and crossed a narrow rope bridge suspended over a crystal-clear stream. Finally, after hours of journeying, Lena arrived at the foot of the legendary waterfall. Its cascading waters sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight, and a gentle mist enveloped the surroundings. Lena felt a sense of wonder and tranquillity as she dipped her hand in the cool waters, as if the legends were coming alive. She sat by the waterfall, captivated by its beauty, pondering the ancient stories that had led her here.\n Q. What intrigued Lena's curiosity in the forest?",

          "question": "Scarlett O'Hara famously asked her husband, Rhett Butler, \"Where shall I go?\" to which he famously replied, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" One of the finest movie quotations ever is found toward the end of director Victor Fleming's 1939 American historical romantic epic film, Gone with the Wind. But in 1930s American society, the term 'damn' was a swear word. Due to the word's offensive nature and consequent prohibition by the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, sometimes known as the 'Hays Code', American film censors insisted on its removal two months prior to the movie's release. A few weeks before the movie's release, the Motion Picture Association of America board amended the Production Code, which caused the censors to change their minds. A word that had originally been offensive became suddenly unoffensive, most likely as a result of the changed sensitivities of American culture that made it possible to update the Motion Picture Production Code. Since then, American perceptions of these issues have advanced significantly. What is offensive to society will continue to be offensive unless its sensibilities significantly shift. People's senses, belief systems, conventions, and practices don't change suddenly. They develop slowly. Therefore, it is meaningless to inquire as to why something should be offensive to some while not being so to others, or why people aren't saner and more tolerant when it comes to sensitive and disputed social topics. Cinema has a significant impact on its consumers since it is a captivating audio-visual medium of entertainment that teaches information, knowledge, beliefs, values, etc. A film's effects on people and society can be either beneficial or bad depending on its subject matter and method of presentation. While a movie may be suitable for certain people's age and sensibilities, it may not be suitable for other people's age and sensibilities. Not everyone is intended to watch every movie. A controversial movie might also spark societal turmoil or even violence. As a result, every nation requires a formal agency to oversee its cinema ethics and policy. In India, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), sometimes known as the 'Censor Board', must certify a movie as appropriate for the purpose before it can be released for public screening. Under the Cinematograph Act of 1952, the CBFC, which operates as a statutory agency under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, controls how movies are shown. Its responsibility is to make sure that the nation's citizens enjoy wholesome enjoyment through cinematic media. The CBFC is required to certify that a movie, in whole or in part, does not jeopardise India's sovereignty and integrity, jeopardise its security and relations with foreign states, cause public disorder or crime, cause defamation or court contempt, violate social norms and values, offend any group of people or community, etc. \n\nQ.

Some people think it's because they lost an eye in battle, but the real reason is much simpler: it's so they can switch the patch from eye to eye and maintain night vision in both eyes. Genius, right? But my favourite pirate quirk has got to be their love of treasure. I mean, who doesn't love a good treasure hunt? But the way pirates go about it is just hilarious. They'll spend months, even years, searching for that one elusive chest of gold, only to bury it on some deserted island and forget where they put it. It's like they're playing an eternal game of hide-and-seek with themselves. And let's not forget about their vocabulary.

To realize this truth, you will have to forget for the time being the history you were taught at school. Because it is that history, drilled into your heads from the time you were children, and constantly renewed by national festivals and ceremonies, the speeches of your leaders, and novels, films, and television serials, that make it seem obvious to you that your nation is ancient. In actual fact, it is not true. Your nation is not - indeed no nation on earth is - ancient. Only modern people can imagine that way.\n Q.

It was the largest ever recorded in the state. The Pawnee earthquake followed the dramatic increase of seismic events in the central United States beginning in 2009, associated with the increase of underground wastewater disposal by oil and gas operators. This and other events in the area raised public concerns and led governmental agencies to shut down injection wells and establish new regulations regarding wastewater injections. While human-caused earthquakes have been documented for more than a century, their increasing number reported worldwide has drawn much scientific, social and political attention. Such earthquakes are related to industrial activities such as mining, construction of water dams, injection of liquids such as waste water and carbon dioxide, and extractions associated with oil and gas exploitation. With the ever-increasing demand for energy and mineral supplies worldwide, the number of human-caused earthquakes is expected to rise in the upcoming years. Some of the largest and more destructive earthquakes of the past few years have been related to man-made activities, such as the 2008 magnitude 7.9 Wenchuan (China) earthquake and the 2015 magnitude 7.8 Nepal earthquake. In most of the cases industrial activities do not induce earthquakes. But this becomes problematic when such activities are close to active faults.

          "question": "On 3 September 2016, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck just northwest of Pawnee, Oklahoma, causing moderate to severe damages in buildings near the epicenter. It was the largest ever recorded in the state. The Pawnee earthquake followed the dramatic increase of seismic events in the central United States beginning in 2009, associated with the increase of underground wastewater disposal by oil and gas operators. This and other events in the area raised public concerns and led governmental agencies to shut down injection wells and establish new regulations regarding wastewater injections. While human-caused earthquakes have been documented for more than a century, their increasing number reported worldwide has drawn much scientific, social and political attention. Such earthquakes are related to industrial activities such as mining, construction of water dams, injection of liquids such as waste water and carbon dioxide, and extractions associated with oil and gas exploitation.

          "question": "Scarlett O'Hara famously asked her husband, Rhett Butler, \"Where shall I go?\" to which he famously replied, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" One of the finest movie quotations ever is found toward the end of director Victor Fleming's 1939 American historical romantic epic film, Gone with the Wind. But in 1930s American society, the term 'damn' was a swear word. Due to the word's offensive nature and consequent prohibition by the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, sometimes known as the 'Hays Code', American film censors insisted on its removal two months prior to the movie's release. A few weeks before the movie's release, the Motion Picture Association of America board amended the Production Code, which caused the censors to change their minds. A word that had originally been offensive became suddenly unoffensive, most likely as a result of the changed sensitivities of American culture that made it possible to update the Motion Picture Production Code. Since then, American perceptions of these issues have advanced significantly. What is offensive to society will continue to be offensive unless its sensibilities significantly shift. People's senses, belief systems, conventions, and practices don't change suddenly. They develop slowly. Therefore, it is meaningless to inquire as to why something should be offensive to some while not being so to others, or why people aren't saner and more tolerant when it comes to sensitive and disputed social topics. Cinema has a significant impact on its consumers since it is a captivating audio-visual medium of entertainment that teaches information, knowledge, beliefs, values, etc. A film's effects on people and society can be either beneficial or bad depending on its subject matter and method of presentation. While a movie may be suitable for certain people's age and sensibilities, it may not be suitable for other people's age and sensibilities. Not everyone is intended to watch every movie. A controversial movie might also spark societal turmoil or even violence. As a result, every nation requires a formal agency to oversee its cinema ethics and policy. In India, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), sometimes known as the 'Censor Board', must certify a movie as appropriate for the purpose before it can be released for public screening. Under the Cinematograph Act of 1952, the CBFC, which operates as a statutory agency under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, controls how movies are shown. Its responsibility is to make sure that the nation's citizens enjoy wholesome enjoyment through cinematic media. The CBFC is required to certify that a movie, in whole or in part, does not jeopardise India's sovereignty and integrity, jeopardise its security and relations with foreign states, cause public disorder or crime, cause defamation or court contempt, violate social norms and values, offend any group of people or community, etc. \n\nQ.

          "question": "Have you ever taken the time to stop and consider the dirt under your feet? Leonardo da Vinci said, “We know more about the movement of celestial bodies than about the soil underfoot.” Yet, our very survival as humans – and life on this planet – is intimately linked with the health of a thin layer of soil enveloping the earth. Soil provides society with essential food, feed, fibre and raw materials, as well as being home to a quarter of the earth’s biodiversity. Soils are also the largest organic carbon reservoir on Earth and although highly dynamic, are very fragile. Chop a forest down and it might grow back in 50 years, but lose 10 cm of soil and get ready to wait 1,000 years to get it back. Without soil, our planet would be unrecognisable to us, and more like the barren and inhospitable surface of the Moon or Mars. Until recently, we did not even know how deep the soil is below our feet. Like the best mysteries, a bit of digging is required for soils to be fully understood and for their history to be laid bare. When they are visible, a range of questions arise. What does the variation in colour with depth mean? How much carbon is stored? Is the soil dense or light, damaged or healthy? Answering these questions is important, but presents a significant challenge and may require years of training.\n Q. What is the tone of the speaker?",

          "question": "Scarlett O'Hara famously asked her husband, Rhett Butler, \"Where shall I go?\" to which he famously replied, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" One of the finest movie quotations ever is found toward the end of director Victor Fleming's 1939 American historical romantic epic film, Gone with the Wind. But in 1930s American society, the term 'damn' was a swear word. Due to the word's offensive nature and consequent prohibition by the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, sometimes known as the 'Hays Code', American film censors insisted on its removal two months prior to the movie's release. A few weeks before the movie's release, the Motion Picture Association of America board amended the Production Code, which caused the censors to change their minds. A word that had originally been offensive became suddenly unoffensive, most likely as a result of the changed sensitivities of American culture that made it possible to update the Motion Picture Production Code. Since then, American perceptions of these issues have advanced significantly. What is offensive to society will continue to be offensive unless its sensibilities significantly shift. People's senses, belief systems, conventions, and practices don't change suddenly. They develop slowly. Therefore, it is meaningless to inquire as to why something should be offensive to some while not being so to others, or why people aren't saner and more tolerant when it comes to sensitive and disputed social topics. Cinema has a significant impact on its consumers since it is a captivating audio-visual medium of entertainment that teaches information, knowledge, beliefs, values, etc. A film's effects on people and society can be either beneficial or bad depending on its subject matter and method of presentation. While a movie may be suitable for certain people's age and sensibilities, it may not be suitable for other people's age and sensibilities. Not everyone is intended to watch every movie. A controversial movie might also spark societal turmoil or even violence. As a result, every nation requires a formal agency to oversee its cinema ethics and policy. In India, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), sometimes known as the 'Censor Board', must certify a movie as appropriate for the purpose before it can be released for public screening. Under the Cinematograph Act of 1952, the CBFC, which operates as a statutory agency under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, controls how movies are shown. Its responsibility is to make sure that the nation's citizens enjoy wholesome enjoyment through cinematic media. The CBFC is required to certify that a movie, in whole or in part, does not jeopardise India's sovereignty and integrity, jeopardise its security and relations with foreign states, cause public disorder or crime, cause defamation or court contempt, violate social norms and values, offend any group of people or community, etc. \n\nQ.

When enacted, it marked the culmination of years of campaigning for a dedicated domestic legislation to deal with sexual offenses against children. Ten years is a reasonable period of time to look back and reflect on how far it has been able to meet the objectives it set out to achieve.\n Objectives of the law: The need for a dedicated law to deal with sexual offenses against children emanated from a realisation that, by failing to account for the specific needs of child victims, the criminal justice system's response to such cases lacked the sensitivity required. To address this concern, the POCSO Act in addition to providing punishment for sexual offenses against children, provided certain safeguards to make children's interaction with the criminal justice system 'child-friendly'. For instance, the child victim should not see the accused at the time of testifying and that trial be held in camera. The evidence of a child shall be recorded within a period of 30 days. The trial court completes the trial, as far as possible, within a period of one year from the date of cognisance. The POCSO rules, 2020 also made a provision for appointment of support persons for victims to render assistance.\n Hurdles in implementation: Implementing a new law in a vast country like India is not an easy task. Though the child protection ecosystem is complex and involves the interplay of multiple actors, when it comes to courts, the delay in disposal of POCSO cases presents one of the biggest challenges in meeting the Act's objectives. There is a huge variation in the average case length across states. For instance, Chandigarh takes about six months (on average) to dispose of a case, Himachal Pradesh takes about two years 10 months. Slow disposals not only impact the accused who might be incarcerated during the duration of the trial but also negatively impact the child victim who might be retraumatised.\n Lessons learnt: Though the Act's implementation is far from perfect, the fact remains that the criminal justice system is more sensitive towards child victims today than it was a decade ago. Since some states are clearly performing better than others, certain best practices can be adopted by other states.

For instance, the child victim should not see the accused at the time of testifying and that trial be held in camera. The evidence of a child shall be recorded within a period of 30 days. The trial court completes the trial, as far as possible, within a period of one year from the date of cognisance. The POCSO rules, 2020 also made a provision for appointment of support persons for victims to render assistance.\n Hurdles in implementation: Implementing a new law in a vast country like India is not an easy task. Though the child protection ecosystem is complex and involves the interplay of multiple actors, when it comes to courts, the delay in disposal of POCSO cases presents one of the biggest challenges in meeting the Act's objectives. There is a huge variation in the average case length across states. For instance, Chandigarh takes about six months (on average) to dispose of a case, Himachal Pradesh takes about two years 10 months. Slow disposals not only impact the accused who might be incarcerated during the duration of the trial but also negatively impact the child victim who might be retraumatised.\n Lessons learnt: Though the Act's implementation is far from perfect, the fact remains that the criminal justice system is more sensitive towards child victims today than it was a decade ago.

Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and told the goat that he deliberately jumped in the well to enjoy its benefits. He kept encouraging the goat to jump in the well. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.” \n Q.

          "question": "Prime Minister Modi has recently declared Modhera, Gujarat as India's first 24x7 solar-powered village. It is an important marker in India's ambitious renewable energy vision. The aim is to increase installed capacity by more than three-fold to 500 GW by 2030. The commercial viability of solar power will have a say in realising this goal. Presently, India's electricity sector displays a dichotomy, representing the challenges facing the renewable sector. Thermal power contributed 75%-85% of the power generated over the last three financial years. Its installed capacity, however, dipped from 62.3% to 59.6% over the same period. During the same phase, solar power installed capacity increased from 9.4% to 12.8% among renewables, its share in a generation increased. Therefore, among available sources of renewable energy, it's solar power that holds the brightest promise. Renewable energy consumption gets a big push from the Government of India in the form of legally binding purchases called Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO). Despite this boost, renewables struggle to meet generation targets because states which have an incentive to keep costs low often fail to meet their RPO. A March 2021 parliamentary committee report showed that only four states met their entire RPO target in 2019-20. Solar power trajectory is delicately poised despite the Government's move to increase the share of RPO till 2030. An increase in the import tariff this year on inputs such as solar modules to boost domestic industry will in the near future push up project costs and, thereby, power tariffs. This is at odds with a separate move to nudge discoms to maintain financial discipline. Moreover, the renewable space itself is set to get more competitive with the advent of green hydrogen. The renewable energy is set for a churn with a complex set of factors at play.\n Q. Identify the structure of the passage.",

Meanwhile, a Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, enquired the reason for which the fox was in the well. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and told the goat that he deliberately jumped in the well to enjoy its benefits. He kept encouraging the goat to jump in the well. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.” \n Q.

          "question": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It is a phenomenon that has been caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. This has led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and can be felt in many different ways. One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. The average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, and this rise is expected to continue in the coming years. This increase in temperature is causing a range of changes in the Earth's climate, including more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and floods. Another consequence of climate change is the loss of biodiversity. As temperatures rise and weather patterns change, many species of plants and animals are struggling to adapt. This is leading to a decline in biodiversity, which is essential for maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Climate change is also having a significant impact on human societies. Rising sea levels, for example, are putting millions of people at risk of flooding and displacement. In addition, changes in weather patterns are leading to crop failures and food shortages, particularly in developing countries where many people rely on subsistence agriculture. To address the issue of climate change, there needs to be a concerted effort at the global level. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the changes that are already taking place. One of the most important steps that can be taken is to transition to renewable energy sources. This means reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and investing in technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Governments can incentivise the adoption of renewable energy by providing subsidies and tax breaks, while businesses can invest in new technologies and sustainable practices. Individuals can also play a role in reducing their carbon footprint. This can be achieved by using public transport instead of driving, reducing meat consumption, and reducing energy consumption at home. Small changes in individual behaviour can add up to make a significant difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, climate change is a complex issue that requires a global response. The consequences of inaction are severe, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its impact. By working together, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.\n Q.

          "question": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It is a phenomenon that has been caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas. This has led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and can be felt in many different ways. One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. The average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by 1.1 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, and this rise is expected to continue in the coming years. This increase in temperature is causing a range of changes in the Earth's climate, including more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and floods. Another consequence of climate change is the loss of biodiversity. As temperatures rise and weather patterns change, many species of plants and animals are struggling to adapt. This is leading to a decline in biodiversity, which is essential for maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Climate change is also having a significant impact on human societies. Rising sea levels, for example, are putting millions of people at risk of flooding and displacement. In addition, changes in weather patterns are leading to crop failures and food shortages, particularly in developing countries where many people rely on subsistence agriculture. To address the issue of climate change, there needs to be a concerted effort at the global level. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the changes that are already taking place. One of the most important steps that can be taken is to transition to renewable energy sources. This means reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and investing in technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Governments can incentivise the adoption of renewable energy by providing subsidies and tax breaks, while businesses can invest in new technologies and sustainable practices. Individuals can also play a role in reducing their carbon footprint. This can be achieved by using public transport instead of driving, reducing meat consumption, and reducing energy consumption at home. Small changes in individual behaviour can add up to make a significant difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, climate change is a complex issue that requires a global response. The consequences of inaction are severe, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its impact. By working together, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.\n Q.

Hence, it is also unsettling that the well-publicised 2022 Global Hunger Index has ranked India at 107 out of 121 countries. It has ranked India behind North Korea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Rwanda, Nigeria and Congo. This doesn't seem to make much sense. But people don't really like digging through the actual reports and methodology. They read the headline and comment on that and move on.

Both are good organisations with long and reputed track records. The report is a 60-page beautiful PDF document, with its heart in the right place. The formatting and language are perfect. It has beautiful pictures, such as of African farm women holding vegetables. At the same time, its rankings are highly questionable. Four criteria are used to determine the final index: prevalence of undernourishment, child stunting rate, child wasting rate, and child mortality. Thus, three of the four criteria are related to children. Child stunting rate is defined as the percentage of children that are two standard deviations below the reference height for a 5-year-old. Child wasting rate is defined as the percentage of children that are two standard deviations below the reference weight for a 5-year-old. The argument is that if our children are not tall enough or do not weigh enough, it is an indicator of national hunger. It is in these parameters that India scored poorly, hence the slippage in rank. The GHI report takes India's data from our own National Family Health Survey 2019-21. This in turn is prepared by the health and family welfare ministry, by surveying a sizable sample of over 61 lakh households. In this 700-plus page survey report also, there is data for India's child stunting and child wasting rates. It says 36% of Indian kids are stunted and 19% of the children are wasted.

Meanwhile, a Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, enquired the reason for which the fox was in the well. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and told the goat that he deliberately jumped in the well to enjoy its benefits. He kept encouraging the goat to jump in the well. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.” \n Q.

Medical science regularly practises transplant surgery and has rid whole countries of such killing diseases as Typhus and the Plague. But the problem of the common cold is unusually difficult and much has yet to be done to solve it. It is known that a cold is caused by one of a number of viral infections that affect the lining of the nose and other passages leading to the lungs, but the confusing variety of viruses makes studying and remedy very difficult. It was shown in 1960 that many typical colds in adults are caused by one or the other of a family of viruses known as rhinoviruses, yet there still remain many colds for which no virus has as yet been isolated. There is also the difficulty that, because they are so much smaller than the bacteria which cause many other infections, viruses cannot be seen with ordinary microscopes. Nor can they be cultivated easily in the bacteriologist’s laboratory, since they only grow within the living cells of animals or plants. An important recent step forward, however, is the development of the technique of tissue culture, in which bits of animal tissue are enabled to go on living and to multiply independently of the body. This has greatly aided virus research and has led to the discovery of a large number of viruses. Their existence had previously been not only unknown but even unsuspected. The fact that we can catch a cold repeatedly creates another difficulty. Usually, a virus strikes only once and leaves the victim immune to further attacks. Still, we do not gain immunity from colds.

Meanwhile, a Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, enquired the reason for which the fox was in the well. Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and told the goat that he deliberately jumped in the well to enjoy its benefits. He kept encouraging the goat to jump in the well. The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.” \n Q.
